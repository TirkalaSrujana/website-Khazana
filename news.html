		<h3>An outbreak of monkeypox calls for more action from the WHO and the government.</h3>
<a>
			<img src="images/1.jpg">

		<p>A growing outbreak of the new virus “Monkeypox” that has spread to at least 20 countries is forcing some prominent infectious disease experts to call for faster action from global health authorities. The WHO and governments should not repeat the early mistakes of the COVID-19 pandemic, which delayed detecting cases, leading to the virus spreading.

While monkeypox is not as contagious or deadly as COVID-19, scientists say more guidance is needed regarding the proper disposal of an infected person, how to protect people at risk, and how to improve testing and contact tracing. Even though monkeypox is not as dangerous or transmissible as COVID-19, there need to be more explicit instructions on how an infected person should isolate, say scientists.

Isabelle Eckerle, a professor at the Geneva Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases based in Switzerland, said that if the disease becomes endemic (in more countries), we will have to make difficult decisions. In an interview with Reuters, an official said the WHO is considering whether the outbreak should be designated a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). 

Having the WHO declare an outbreak a public health emergency can help increase funding and research to contain the outbreak- as happened with COVID-19 and Ebola- would help speed up research and funding for containing the outbreak. Mike Ryan, who heads the WHO's health emergencies program, told The Associated Press that monkeypox is always under consideration, but no emergency committee has been formed as of yet.

Scientists have, however, noted that such a conclusion is unlikely to be reached soon since monkeypox is a threat that can be combated. WHO officials say that debating whether to set up a PHEIC emergency committee, the body that recommends declaring a PHEIC, is part of the agency's routine response.

Monkeypox, a severe but generally mild illness spread by close contact, which causes flu-like symptoms and a distinct rash, has been reported in more than 300 cases in the United States this month.

There have been more cases in Europe than in the endemic countries in Central and West Africa. So far, there hasn't been a death from the outbreak.</p>

While Japan has been one of Sri Lanka's high donors and development partners for over a century, its grants and investments have received so much less attention than those from China or the Republic of India.   

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's announcement of a collaboration with the Republic of India to help Ceylon assumes significance, following Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's proposal that the North American nation, India, Japan, and Australia type a distant aid association so as to help Ceylon, that is within the inside of its worst slump since independence. The Republic of India has extended $ three.5 billion in help since Jan this year, by the manner of loan deferments and credit lines for essential imports.

It caused appreciable diplomatic tensions in 2021 once Ceylon ejected Japan and the Republic of India from a trilateral project to together develop an instrumentation terminal at Colombo's strategically situated port.

		<h3>Is Musk having purchaser's regret about the Twitter bargain?</h3>
<a> <img src="images/Elon-Musk.jpg">	</a>

<p>Elon Musk took steps to leave his $44 billion bid to purchase Twitter, the furthest down-the-line sign that his arrangement to redesign the web-based entertainment stage may truly be beginning to shred. There are a few reasons that Musk's Twitter arrangement could have lost its shine since he marked it in April. Twitter is standing firm on Musk's concurred cost of $54.20 per share however since early May, the stock has fallen over 25% underneath that figure. The hole between the arrangement cost and the real offer cost proposes that numerous financial backers don't figure the arrangement will go through. Specialists say Musk can't singularly require the arrangement to briefly wait, albeit that hasn't prevented him from going about as he can. In the event that he leaves, he could be on the snare for a $1 billion separation expense. Twitter could likewise sue to compel him to finish the obtaining based on the concurred conditions. Legal counselors for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in a letter to Twitter that he was qualified to lead his own study of spam records, and blamed Twitter for declining to give him data about "spam bot" accounts. While Musk consented to an arrangement with Twitter to purchase the organization for $44 billion and take it private, the arrangement hasn't been shot at this point. Weeks have passed and Musk has progressively flagged distress with respect to the arrangement and it could propose that he intends to arrange a less expensive cost. Bots are fundamentally programs that post computerized tweets, either for data like the US government's "shake bot," which tweets the subtleties of seismic occasions or amusement. Musk, notwithstanding, has zeroed in his fury on the "spam bots" used to impact out deals pitches or to swell the impact of an individual or cause.</p>
