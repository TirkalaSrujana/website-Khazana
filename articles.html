   <h1>The Ultimate Productivity Hack is Saying No</h1><br>

<h4>Not doing commodities will always be quicker than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old computer programming saying, “ Flash back that there's no law briskly than no law. ”</h4><br>
<p1> The same ideology applies in other areas of life. For illustration, there's no meeting that goes sooner than not having a meeting at all.</p1><br>

<br><div><p1>The truth is that we say yes to multiple things we don't actually want to do. It's worth asking if stuff is necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple “ no ” will be more productive than whatever work the most effective person can muster.</p1></div><br>
<br><div>The words “ yes ” and “ no ” get used in comparison to each other so constantly that it feels like they carry equal weight in discussion.</div>
<br><div> In reality, they are not just contrary in meaning, but of entirely different extents commitment.When you say no, you are only saying no to one option. When you say yes, you are saying no to everyotheroption.In other words, saying no saves you time in the future.No is a form of time credit.</div>
<br><div>You retain the capability to spend your coming time however you want. Yes is a form of time debt. You have to pay back your commitment at some point.</div><br>
<br><h4>No is a decision. Yes is a responsibility</h4>
